*link*CSS Ellipsis

The `CSS Ellipsis` widget is the A12 solution for truncating long texts. It uses `-webkit-line-clamp` to create the ellipsis, and it can automatically calculate the number of rows to clamp. The full content will be shown in a title attribute on hover by default, and it can also be customized to use a tooltip.

Warning

*warning*

**NOTE**

**This CSS solution has many technical limitations on the content in order for it to be properly truncated:**

- There should be no margin/padding for the content. CSS Ellipsis will remove the padding/margin of its children.
- The content should have the same line height throughout.
- BulletList truncation doesn't work on Safari at the moment. If your list consists of short length items, consider converting it to a comma separated list instead.
- The parent element should have a fixed height.

*link*Basic

A `maxLine` property is provided in case the number of lines to show is known. In the first example, only two lines will be shown.

If no `maxLine` is given, the truncation will be calculated based on the parent element's size. In the second example the parent element's height is set to 60px.

In either case, a title with the full text content will be displayed on hover.

**First example with maxLine set to 2.** The A12 widget library is part of the A12 Business Application Platform.

*link*Ellipsis With Tooltip

Instead of showing the title on hover, a tooltip can be shown by setting `useTooltip` to true.

The `hint` variant is set by default, but if you'd like to customize the tooltip's appearance you can instead pass `success`, `warning` or `error` to the`tooltipVariant` property.
