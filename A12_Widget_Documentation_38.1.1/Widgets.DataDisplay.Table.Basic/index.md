The **Table** Widget is a presentational component that visualizes a data set in fully customizable rows and columns. It's often used to embed structured data in a way such that users can easily scan and look for patterns and insights. A **Table** can include:

- A corresponding visualization
- Navigation
- Tools to query and manipulate data

Please have a look at the [Multiselect Table](../Examples.MultiselectTable/index.md) where we already implemented some features as an example.

*link*Basic

A **Table** has two important properties you should take note of:

- `data`: let you define the data that should be displayed as rows in the table.
- `columns`: let you define the columns of the table. Each column is of type `BaseColumnType` which lets you specify the column's label, width, alignments, pinning and so forth.

Other key properties you'll frequently use are `width`, `fixedWidth`, `pinning` and `actionColumn`.

The default value of `width` is **1.0**, but other decimal values (up to 2 decimal places) can also be passed; **0.5** or **1.3**, for example.

Normally the widths of the various columns are calculated automatically based on the table's width, the **width** property of each column and the total number of columns.

However, for columns where `fixedWidth` is set to **true**, a fixed width of **width\*150px** will be applied. Unlike normal columns, those with fixed widths will NOT shrink/expand as the width of the table changes. By default, columns have `fixedWidth` set to **false**, except for pinned columns where its set to **true**.

Speaking of pinned columns, when screen space is limited it may not be possible for all of your columns to display at once without scrolling. If some of your columns are particularly important, you can prioritize them to display without scrolling by setting their `pinning` property to **true**.

If you need to include some type of actions in your table such as editing or deleting, you can use an `actionColumn` (or multiple action columns).

The example below uses many features of the Table widget:

- Pinned Column, Column Width and Column Alignment
- Action Column
- Select & Sort
- Row Highlighting

The example below optimizes the Table widget with additional contents for the Header Row and Body Rows.

You can trigger the Filter Header Cell to display the filters for the Body's data. These filters have been added to this example by creating the `headFilterContentRenderer` of the `componentRenderers` property.

You can also expand each Row to see the additional content. These additional contents are made of `TableTemplate.BodyRow`, `TableTemplate.ExpandableRow`, `TableTemplate.ExpandableRowBody` and `TableTemplate.ExpandableRowFooter` as the `additionalContentRenderer`inside the `componentRenderers` property. Also, the `footContentRenderer` and `footRowRenderer` of `componentRenderers` property has also been used to create the Footer.

Besides, additional features have also been added to make this example feel more alive:

- [Pagination](../Widgets.DataDisplay.Pagination/index.md) widget has been used to navigate between pages of the table.
- Action Column
- Select & Sort
- Row Highlighting

Warning

*warning*

**NOTE**

The recommended way of supporting **accessibility** for the expandable table is to pass the `buttonAttributes` and `title` properties into the Icon Button that triggers opening/closing the expandable row. For the sake of clarity, let's look at an example:

- Set `buttonAttributes` to `{"aria-expanded"=true/false}` when the Icon Button is clicked/not clicked.
- Set `title` to `open/close` when the Icon Button is clicked/not clicked.

*link*Column Grouping

In some cases that you need to create a multi-column table, you can make any Column expand across its Sub-columns by passing the `subColumns` property to its data. The Table allows to nest its Columns to upmost 3 levels. To further customize the header Cell of the spanned Column, please use the `headCellGroupRenderer` provided in the `componentRenderers` property.

Each spanned Column will have the following behaviors:

- The `horizontalAlignment` and `verticalAlignment` properties are centered by default and have no effect on its `subColumns`.
- The following properties will be ignored:
  - `sortable`
  - `sortDirections`
  - `width`
  - `fixedWidth`
  - specific `horizontalAlignment`: `{body, foot}`
  - specific `verticalAlignment`: `{body, foot}`
- The `pinning` only works for the **first-level** column-span.

**Accessibility reminder:** Because of the complicated HTML structure of grouped columns, the screen readers will not be able to provide an accurate mapping for the contents of the Table's headers and cells. We DO NOT recommend using Table with spanned Columns for accessibility usage.

In this example, besides of the multi-columns, additional features have also been added to make it more alive:

- Pinned columns
- Select & Sort
- Row Highlighting

*link*Row Grouping

This example makes use of the **TableRowsGroup** widget that is recommended to use when the table requires grouping rows.

The `data` property used in the TableRowsGroup is a set of **RowsGroup** which contain the following properties:

- `head`: the title of the group.
- `subRows`: rows that should be grouped.
- `ariaLabel`: should be used to make screen readers recognize and read it as a group by setting the value the same as the `head` property.
- `collapsed`: to hide or show corresponding sub rows.

To collapse/expand a row group, you can customize the row group header by using `rowGroupHeaderRenderer` with an action button which is responsible for updating the row corresponding to the `collapsed` state.

Warning

*warning*

**NOTE**

In this example, we follow A11Y requirements by using the [Link](../Widgets.General.Link/index.md) Widget with appropriate ARIA attributes, such as `role="button"` and `aria-expanded="true/false"`. This ensures compliance with hover, tab focus, and semantic standards.Additionally, accessibility in custom components using `rowGroupHeaderRenderer` can be enhanced by:

- Set `linkAttributes` to `{"aria-expanded": true/false}` depending on the collapsed state of the row.
- Set `title` to `Expand group/Collapse group` depending on the collapsed state of the row.

*link*Cross Tabulation

To create a Cross Tabulation similar to the following example, please define the columns as usual and set `verticalHeader` to the one that is expected to be a vertical header. That column will be pinned left by default. Once `verticalHeader` property is set, the other left side pin would be considered as a vertical header as well.

A vertical header is actually a normal column filled with body cell content but has the same styling as the horizontal header, so it could only be sorted vertically.

It is recommended to also use the `cellHiglighting` property for Cross Tabulation to make the corresponding Header Cells highlighted when hovering over the Body Cells.

*link*Customizations

The Table offers many options for customization.

In this example:

- The *Status* Column has been configured as `subInfo` to mark the cells of that column as sub-info areas. You can do this by setting the `subInfo` property of any Column to `true`.
- There are 3 Row variants: selected, success, and disabled.
- Cells in the *Description* Column have been configured as **secondaryCell** to mark them as secondary info. You can do this by setting the `useSecondaryColor` of the `cellStyling` property to `true`.
