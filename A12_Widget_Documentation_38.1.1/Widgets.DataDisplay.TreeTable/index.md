*link*Tree Table

The **Tree Table** Widget displays hierarchical data in rows and columns. It is a combination of the [Table](../Widgets.DataDisplay.Table/index.md) and [Tree](../Widgets.DataDisplay.Tree/index.md).

- API

*link*Basic

You can handle events when the row or arrow button is clicked by passing corresponding handlers to the `rowEventHandlers` property.

- `onClick`: to handle an event when the row is clicked. For example, to update the selection state of a row.
- `onArrowClick`: to handle an event when the arrow button of a row is clicked. For example, to toggle the expanding/collapsing state of a node.

To set states for a specific row, you can use the `rowStyling` property that provides some variants on whether the row is interactive, selected, disabled or highlighted.

You can trigger the row action with Enter on a cell.

*link*Async

This example demonstrates how to create a Tree asynchronously. The fetch process will take a bit of time to show the hidden data. The loading icon will be shown during that time.

*link*Accessibility

To fully support accessibility, the **TreeTable** should have its own `id`. It will be used to create an **id** for the **hidden text** that is placed in front of the interactive Tree Table for screen-readers. That id will be linked to the **aria-labelledby** attribute. In addition, you can link the external ids via the `ariaLabelledby` property.

If you'd like to add more hidden texts, you can use the `ariaLabel` property.

*link*Content Type Example

Provide all relevant examples of nodes and children in the initially collapsed and expandable states in combination with the following errors and warnings:

- The parent has a warning, the children have no issues
- The parent has an error, the children have no issues
- The parent has no issue, but the children have warnings
- The parent has no issue, but the children have errors
- The parent has a warning, the children have warnings
- The parent has an error, the children have errors

Edge cases:

- The parent has a warning, the children have errors
- The parent has an error, the children have errors
- The parent has a warning, the children have both
- The parent has an error, the children have both
