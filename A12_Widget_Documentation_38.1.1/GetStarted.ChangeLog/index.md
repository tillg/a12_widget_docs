37.0.0

Breaking Changes

- Deletion of many "State" interfaces. States are internal, but the TypeScript interfaces for many widgets were exported. Since the rewrite of many widgets to React functional components, state interfaces are obsolete and therefore deleted. This should not affect users of widgets, but is documented here for the sake of completeness.
  - ApplicationFrameState
  - ProgressIndicatorState
  - PopUpMenuState
  - TooltipState
- **Table:** When a drag event is triggered, the row preview image is now always rendered as a separate React component instead of using browser's native renderer. The dragging row rendered by the new preview layer is not rendered inside the Table Body. Therefore, any custom Context Provider that created inside the Table Body, which then could be accessed by each row, will no longer be accessible.
- **Tree Table, Table:** The default of aria-attributes are not available in table footer, use the `hasFootContent` property to specify whether you want to render the table footer's aria-attributes or not.
- **Application Frame:** [A11Y]
  - [Mobile] Remove the `tabIndex` attribute from the **main container** to prevent screen readers from focusing on the wrapper.
  - If the focus handling is customized for mobile use, the introduction of the new fallback focus behavior might interfere with it.
- **Text Output:** By default, the Text Output content is now wrapped by paragraph tags for improved semantics. A `disableParagraphWrapping` property has also been introduced for situations where this default behavior may not be desired (such as when working with block level elements).
- **Timepicker:** The default value of `closeOnBackdropClick` has been changed from `true` to `false` on mobile/tablet.
- **FlyoutMenu, Sliding Menu, List, Date Picker, Accordion, Table, Filter Selector:** The selected color has been changed from `#e6f4fe` to `#f5fbff`.
- **Table:** The background color of embedded content in the expanded table has been changed from `#f1f2f4` to `#f9fafb` when hovering or focusing on the table row.
- **Popup Menu:** [A11Y]
  - [Mobile, Tablet] Display popup menu from the bottom and add a visible close button for improved navigation with screen readers, avoiding position loss.
  - The `closeOnOutsideClick` property is only enabled by default on desktop or when `enableA11YMobileDesign` is set to `false` in the configuration of the **PopupMenuConfigContext**.
- **@com.mgmtp.a12.widgets/react-virtualized-fork@10.0.0** is no longer available since the original **react-virtualized** library now supports React 18.
- **Button:** Adjusting the Icon Button
  - The `withBackground` property has been removed since the `invert` icon button's appearance now varies depending on its type (regular, primary, secondary, and active).
  - The regular icon button now has a round shape in the Default and Flat themes.
- **Message Color - Warning:**
  - The appearance of the `warning` variant has been adjusted for better contrast.
  - Introduce a dark color and text color for each variant:
    - `variant.errorColorDark`
    - `variant.infoColorDark`
    - `variant.successColorDark`
    - `variant.warningColorDark`
    - `variant.text.error`
    - `variant.text.info`
    - `variant.text.success`
    - `variant.text.warning`
- **Status:** The deprecated `light` property has been removed. The alternative way to customize the Status is to use the theme variables.

New Features

- **Date Time Picker, Time Picker:** Making behaviors consistent between desktop and mobile that only save the selected date time when clicking the OK button.
- **HeaderTrigger:** [A11Y] Introduced a new `hideHiddenText` property that specifies whether the hidden text should be hidden from screen readers or not.
- **Tag Input:**
  - Introduce a new `comparator` property that allows users to implement a custom sorting order function for list items when opening the dropdown.
  - [A11Y] Mobile: Some adjustments to support the screen reader's visual focus tracking of the correct tag item.
- **Button, Dropdown:** Provide and adjust some configuration keys for styling purposes.
- **Button Group Container:** Provide the `popupMenuHeaderTitle` property to customize the header title of the **Popup Menu** in case responsive behavior is enabled.
- **Popup Menu:** Provide the property `headerTitle` to display a header with a title and a close button for the Popup Menu on mobile and tablet devices.
- **Content Box:**
  - The Button's properties now can be used for the `ContentBoxElements.BackButton` and `ContentBoxElements.CloseButton` components.
  - `ActionButton` and `HeadingActionButton` have been introduced. They have the same appearance with the `ContentBoxElements.BackButton` and `ContentBoxElements.CloseButton` but can now be used for a different action. The difference between these 2 elements is the `ActionButton` is a single button, meanwhile the `HeadingActionButton` is an addon that contains the `ActionButton`.

- **Master Detail:** The divider between panels is missing if there are more than 2 panels.

- **Tag Input:** [A11Y] Swiping to choose the available tag from search results does not work with Talkback (Android) enabled.

New Features

  The main benefits of the `Rich Text Editor` are that it was built using [Lexical](https://lexical.dev/) (whereas the existing `Plugin Editor` uses the now deprecated draft-js) and that it includes the `@com.mgmtp.a12.widgets/widgets-core/lib/experimental/rich-text-editor/main/themes/rich-text-editor.css` file, which can be imported into the application to apply default styling to the editor.

  - Previously the `light` and `dark` properties were used to create an inverted icon button with a rounded background or a square shape respectively. This does not make sense with different theme we have. Now, use `invert` to make the button standout from the background. It will have the square shape by default. Use withBackground to add the rounded background that was included previously with the light button.
  - The outline secondary button has been change to `invert secondary`.
  - The invert primary button stay unchanged.

- **ResizeAndDragContainer:** `[key: string]: any` from `ResizeAndDragContainerProps` that allow passing properties with wrong key has been removed.
