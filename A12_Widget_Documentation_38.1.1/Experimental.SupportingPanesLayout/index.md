*link*Supporting Panes Layout

The **Supporting Panes Layout (SPL)** widgets divides content horizontally into *primary* and *secondary* panes:

- The **primary pane**, which takes up most of the body area, contains the main content.
- The **secondary (supporting) pane** provides additional supporting content to enhance context and understanding. This may include additional information, related data, contextual actions, and children in a parent-child relationship.

The **SPL** can be nested within itself or combined with other widgets, allowing for complex, multi-level designs.

*link*Basic

We provide a set of components `SupportingPanesLayoutComponents` to build a Supporting Panes Layout.

- `SupportingPanesLayout` is a base container that wraps the primary and secondary panes.
- `PrimaryPane` element to contain the main content that should always be presented. Its width is flexible based on the available space.
- `SecondaryPane` element to define supporting content. The pane is resizable, and can be collapsed or expanded. There are certain properties that are helpful to control its behaviors:
  - `position`: Whether it will be displayed to the left or right side of the main content.
  - `widthConfig`: The pane's width can be altered when it is expanded or collapsed. By default, the pane will take up 25% of the entire layout.
  - `collapsed`: The collapse/expand state can be controlled externally with this. For example, by clicking a button.
  - `resizeOptions`: To enable the resize behavior, you have to define `minWidth` and `maxWidth` via this configuration.
  - `hide`: Whether the pane should be hidden or not.

If both `minWidth` and `widthConfig.collapsed` are specified for the **resize** behavior, the supporting pane will shrink until it reaches the minimum width, then jump back to the collapsed state.

Hovering over the gap between the supporting pane and primary pane will show the resize handle that you can drag, then the width of the pane will be gradually adjusted.

We also provide a feature that allows users to double-click the resize handler on the supporting pane to collapse, expand, or reset it to its default expanded width.

Secondary Pane

The Supporting Pane is a side panel that can be positioned either in front or behind the Primary Pane. It can contain anything that supports the interaction with the Primary Pane.

It could be a [Content Box](../Widgets.Layout.ContentBox/index.md) with a [Menu](../Widgets.Navigation.Menu.FlyoutMenu#verticalMenu/index.md) or a **Form** here.

The pane will disappear if click the button below:

Primary Pane

The Primary Pane is where users can focus on and interact with the most important information. Regardless of whether the pane is standalone or with one or two supporting panes, it will take up the remaining free space.

You can display the amounts of data by putting a [Table](../Widgets.DataDisplay.Table/index.md), or [Tree Table](../Widgets.DataDisplay.TreeTable/index.md) here. Click a Table Row will probably open a detail form in the Supporting Pane.

Another layout can be specified within the `PrimaryPane` to create multi-level design.
