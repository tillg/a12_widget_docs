This is an example that shows how to use the `Sidebar` with the [Tab Panel](../Widgets.Navigation.TabPanel/index.md).

At any given time the Sidebar can be in one of three different states:

1. Collapsed
2. Expanded for a partial-screen view
3. Expanded for a full-screen view

The `subExpanded` property is used to expand or collapse the Sidebar.

In this example, you can expand the SideBar by selecting a tab, and collapse it by clicking the close button or deselecting the currently selected tab.

You can use the `subExpandedState` property to dictate whether the Sidebar takes up only part of the screen, or expands to fill the entire screen.

You can see an example of how this works by clicking the minimize/maximize button located in the header of the panel.
